## Your Name:

Karla Alba

## What you like most about web design development

The problem-solving aspect is by far my favorite. From my point of view, if there's something you can't do while programming/developing, it's because you haven't found the answer.  

## What you like least about web design and development

The initial training aspect. I wish it would be easier to retain specific functions instead of having to look them up all the time. 

## How do you see yourself using web design and development skills in your career?

I really want to help many small libraries build better sites. My first short-term goal is working with a committee to redesign my library's site.
